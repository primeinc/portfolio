# Setup Script Production Improvements Roadmap

**Script Version:** 1.0.0  
**Date:** 2025-05-30  
**Status:** 90% Production Ready

## ✅ Completed Improvements

### Security & Validation

- [x] Environment variable sanitization
- [x] Sensitive data redaction in logs
- [x] Path and URL validation
- [x] Atomic lock file with PID tracking
- [x] Secure Volta installation (no curl|bash)

### Cross-Platform Support

- [x] Robust platform detection (macOS/Linux/WSL)
- [x] Multiple fallback methods for port detection
- [x] Platform-specific command variations

### CI/CD Integration

- [x] Detection for 10+ CI platforms
- [x] Platform-specific logging
- [x] Non-interactive mode handling
- [x] Container environment detection and handling

### Quick Wins Implemented

- [x] Script version tracking (v1.0.0)
- [x] Execution time measurement
- [x] Healthcheck file generation (.setup-health.json)
- [x] Container-specific adjustments (color, browser, warnings)

## 🔧 Remaining Improvements for Full Production

### 1. Network Retry Logic (High Priority)

```bash
download_with_retry() {
  # Implement exponential backoff
  # Support both curl and wget
  # Configurable timeout and attempts
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Signal Handling (High Priority)

```bash
cleanup_on_signal() {
  # Graceful shutdown on INT/TERM/HUP
  # Kill child processes
  # Release locks
  # Exit with proper codes
}
```

### 3. Resource Checks (High Priority)

```bash
check_system_resources() {
  # Verify 1GB+ disk space
  # Check write permissions
  # Warn on low memory (<512MB)
  # Validate temp directory access
}
```

### 4. Checksum Verification (Medium Priority)

```bash
declare -A VOLTA_INSTALLER_CHECKSUMS=(
  ["1.1.1"]="sha256:checksum_here"
)
# Verify downloads against known checksums
```

### 5. Backup Mechanism (Medium Priority)

```bash
backup_file() {
  # Backup .env.local before modification
  # Keep last 5 backups with timestamps
  # Enable rollback capability
}
```

### 6. Advanced Container Support (Low Priority)

- Volume persistence recommendations
- Docker Compose integration examples
- Kubernetes ConfigMap generation

## 🚀 Deployment Recommendations

1. **Testing Protocol**

   - Test on all target platforms
   - Verify CI behavior in GitHub Actions
   - Test container deployment
   - Validate WSL2 compatibility

2. **Monitoring**

   - Use .setup-health.json for health checks
   - Monitor setup.log for errors
   - Track execution times
   - Alert on lock timeouts

3. **Documentation**
   - Document known limitations
   - Provide troubleshooting guide
   - Include platform-specific notes
   - Maintain changelog

## 📈 Version History

### v1.0.0 (Current)

- Initial production-ready release
- Comprehensive security hardening
- Cross-platform compatibility
- CI/CD integration
- Basic monitoring (healthcheck)

### v1.1.0 (Planned)

- Network retry logic
- Enhanced signal handling
- Resource pre-flight checks
- Checksum verification

### v1.2.0 (Future)

- Backup/rollback system

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Implement network retry logic (2-3 hours)
2. Add signal handling (1 hour)
3. Add resource checks (1 hour)
4. Test across all platforms (2-3 hours)
5. Create troubleshooting guide (1 hour)

**Total estimated effort to 100% production ready: 8-10 hours**

The script is currently suitable for production use with monitoring. The remaining improvements enhance reliability in edge cases and adverse conditions.
