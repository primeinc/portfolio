# Portfolio Setup Script Security Report

**Date:** 2025-05-30  
**Script:** `dev_setup.sh`  
**Status:** Security improvements implemented

## Executive Summary

Critical security improvements have been implemented in the portfolio monorepo setup script to address vulnerabilities identified during code review. All high-priority security issues have been resolved.

## Completed Security Fixes

### 1. ✅ Removed curl|bash Vulnerability (Critical)

**Issue:** Direct piping of remote scripts to bash poses security risks.

**Solution:**

- Downloads Volta installer to temporary file for inspection
- Validates script content before execution
- Uses atomic cleanup with trap handlers
- Validates installer URL before download

### 2. ✅ Environment Variable Sanitization (High)

**Issue:** Unsanitized environment variables could lead to code injection.

**Solution:**

- Sanitizes critical environment variables at script start
- Removes null bytes and control characters
- Enforces safe character sets for PATH-like variables
- Re-exports sanitized values

### 3. ✅ Input Validation (High)

**Issue:** User inputs and paths were not validated.

**Solution:**

- Added `validate_path()` function to check for:
  - Path traversal attempts (..)
  - Shell metacharacters
  - Null bytes
- Added `validate_url()` function to ensure:
  - HTTPS-only URLs
  - Valid domain patterns
  - No shell injection attempts

### 4. ✅ Secure Logging with Redaction (High)

**Issue:** Sensitive data could be exposed in logs.

**Solution:**

- Implemented `redact_sensitive()` function
- Automatically redacts:
  - API keys (20+ character strings)
  - Tokens, passwords, secrets
  - Authorization headers
  - SSH keys
- Console output shows original, logs store redacted version

### 5. ✅ Platform and Conflict Detection (Medium)

**Issue:** Script needed better environment detection.

**Solution:**

- Enhanced platform detection for WSL, macOS, Linux
- Detects conflicting Node.js version managers (nvm, fnm, n, asdf, nodenv)
- Provides specific uninstall instructions
- Prevents Volta installation conflicts

## Test Results

### Platform Detection

- ✅ Correctly identifies WSL2 environment
- ✅ Detects Microsoft kernel in /proc/version
- ✅ Sets IS_WSL flag appropriately

### Version Manager Conflicts

- ✅ Successfully detected fnm installation
- ✅ Blocked Volta installation with clear error message
- ✅ Provided accurate uninstall commands

### Security Features

- ✅ Environment sanitization removes dangerous characters
- ✅ Path validation blocks traversal and injection attempts
- ✅ URL validation enforces HTTPS and safe patterns
- ✅ Sensitive data redaction works for all common patterns

## Remaining Tasks

### Medium Priority Testing

1. **Log Rotation:** Verify .setup-logs/ cleanup after 7 days
2. **Process Recovery:** Test killing setup mid-run
3. **PID Management:** Verify dev server PID file handling
4. **Lock File:** Test concurrent setup attempts
5. **File Accumulation:** Check for orphaned files after multiple runs
6. **CI Mode:** Test non-interactive behavior in CI environments

### Future Improvements

1. **Modular Structure:** Create lib/ directory for reusable functions
2. **Enhanced Validation:** Add GPG signature verification for downloads
3. **Audit Trail:** Implement detailed audit logging
4. **Rollback Support:** Add automatic rollback on failure

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Defense in Depth:** Multiple layers of validation
2. **Fail Secure:** Script exits on any security check failure
3. **Least Privilege:** No unnecessary permissions requested
4. **Input Sanitization:** All external inputs validated
5. **Secure Defaults:** HTTPS required, sensitive data redacted

## Recommendations

1. **Run Regular Security Audits:** Review script quarterly
2. **Monitor Dependencies:** Keep Volta, Node.js, pnpm versions current
3. **Test in CI:** Add automated security tests to CI pipeline
4. **Document Changes:** Maintain security changelog
5. **User Education:** Document security features in README

## Conclusion

The setup script now implements industry-standard security practices. All critical vulnerabilities have been addressed. The script is significantly more resistant to common attack vectors while maintaining usability and idempotence.

The remaining medium-priority tests focus on operational reliability rather than security vulnerabilities. These can be addressed in subsequent iterations based on actual usage patterns.
